	At my leisure time I read and write about Frontend development, when can I help to organize local tech events and teach what I learn during my journey as an IT and web developer through tweets or talks. I have a deep passion for Japanese culture, having been influenced by animes, so much that I am currently having so much fun studying Japanese. And I really like music.
